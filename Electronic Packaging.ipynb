    "# Electronic Packaging\n",
    "In the commonly used electronic technology, the semiconductor chips are individually mounted on a package, and wire-bonded to its I/O pins. This package is then mounted on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB).\n",
    "However, not only does *packaging of single chip ICs cost more than the cost of the chips they contain*, packaging of a chip take relatively large amount of physical space. Using a conventional single chip package and circuit board interconnect strategy, **the package and interconnects took up over 50% of the timing budget as well.**\n",
    "* **Through hole PWB** --> the leads on the components are inserted into pre-drilled holes on printed circuit boards on one side and then soldered to pads on opposite side of PCB\n",
    "* **Surface Mount Technology (SMT)** --> electronic circuits are assembled by mounting the active/passive components directly onto the surfaces of printed circuit boards. Benefits: suitable for automated machines, smaller physical size, less parasitic and low cost\n",
    "* **Hybrid Technology** --> see [1]\n",

    "An unpackaged semiconductor die is attached directly onto the surface of a PCB substrate along with signal conditioning or support circuitry. Electrical connections are formed when the IC is attached to the corresponding substrate interconnects with wire bonding. A junction coating material(epoxy resin or a silicone coating) is then applied on top of the die to encapsulate and protective die and wire bonds.\n",
